# Compare

## About

`compare` will do it's best (which isn't much) to give you a GitHub comparison URL
between your current branch and development.

## Install

`make` will install `compare` in `$HOME/bin`.  If you'd like to put it somewhere else,
you'll need to modify `BINDIR` in `bin/compare.sh`.  Maybe someday I'll make it 
smarter, but probably not.

## Use

    $ compare

That'll generate the link and attempt to `open` it, so that means it'll probably only
work on OS X.  Sorry about that.
